# Info

This is my personal daily driver rofi configuration that I use for personal and work activities.

It includes some scripts I created for those activities.

# Relevant Commands
I use this repo as a git submodule on my dotfiles.  
The following command is isued on the dotfiles repo, to have this one as a submodule.
```shell
git submodule add git@github.com:pncolvr/dotfiles-rofi.git .config/rofi
```

## When cloning a "parent repo" to include the submodules

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules <repository-url>
```
_or_ if we cloned the repo without the submodules
```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

# Syncing submodules

```shell
git submodule sync --recursive
```
